Machine Learning Project: Regression & Classification
This project demonstrates end-to-end implementation of machine learning workflows on two datasets:

Loan dataset for regression tasks & Credit card dataset for classification tasks

It focuses on data preprocessing, visualization, modeling, evaluation, and performance tuning using various machine learning techniques.

Project Overview
Regression Task: Predicting loan-related values using Linear, Ridge, and Ensemble models (Gradient Boosting).

Classification Task: Predicting fraudulent credit card transactions using KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Stacking Classifier.

Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values and outliers using boxplots and median replacement.

Addressed class imbalance:

For regression: Balanced outlier-influenced distributions.

For classification: Applied undersampling for class balancing.

Performed feature distribution analysis using:

Histograms, Scatter plots, and Correlation heatmaps

Models Used
Regression Models (Loan Dataset)
Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regressor

Evaluation Metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE),Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE),Mean Absolute Error (MAE),and RÂ² Score

Classification Models (Credit Card Dataset)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Stacking Classifier (model ensemble)

Evaluation Metrics:

Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

Visualizations
Boxplots for outlier detection, Histograms for feature distributions, Scatter plots for feature relationships, and Heatmaps to explore feature correlation
